                    Reddit, "the front page of the internet", has often found its communities play a prominent role in the origination and propagation of hateful discourse. The sheer number of posts and comments each day makes community moderation an arduous task for the handful of administrators on Reddit. Consequently, transgressions continue unchecked until they leak into the real world, at which point the media pressure leaves Reddit no choice but to take action. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    This <b>reactive</b> approach to content moderation hasn't worked well for Reddit. There are several examples <span class="italic-text">(see <a href="javascript:scrollTo('#action-table-anchor')">Table 1</a>)</span> of hateful discourse on Reddit reaching mainstream media, whose subsequent backlash prompts the moderators to take action. The action taken can range from a simple quarantine to an outright ban for that particular community. However, these post-hoc steps are merely damage control as the real harm has already been done.

                    Reddit's latest content policy prohibits content if it,
                    <ul>
                        <li>is illegal</li> 
                        <li>is involuntary pornography</li>
                        <li>is sexual or suggestive content involving minors</li>
                        <li>encourages or incites violence</li>
                        <li>threatens, harasses, or bullies or encourages others to do so</li>

                    The Reddit content policy defines the type of content that is acceptable for posting on the platform. With modest beginnings, the policy has seen several revisions over the years since. These revisions were often made in response to media backlash over controversial posts. However, the policy itself holds no sway until it is adhered to. Again, the moderators responsible for ensuring this are outnumbered by the sheer number of posts and comments.

                <p class="text">
                    In this project, we investigate the feasibility of proactive moderation on Reddit – i.e., proactively identifying communities at risk of committing offenses that previously resulted in bans for other communities. This approach provides insight into how the content of a community and its user base evolve over time. This alleviates the need for human moderators to actively review content for identifying policy violations. Knowing that a community is gravitating towards hateful content allows pre-emptive measures to be taken to control the fallout.

                    Communities on Reddit are known as subreddits. A subreddit is meant to either serve as a common forum for discussion or cater to a niche interest among the Reddit community. From this, it is reasonable to conclude that any particular subreddit would achieve topical and user stability over time. Because subreddits are created for a particular interest, they should ideally remain relevant to that interest throughout their existence. However, results from our study prove otherwise.
                </p>
                <p class="text">We consider a dataset of 3000 subreddits for our study which we refer to as <span class="italic-text">D<sub>A</sub></span>. For a more qualitative analysis, we divide <span class="italic-text">D<sub>A</sub></span> into 3 categories: hateful subreddits <span class="italic-text">D<sub>H</sub></span>, banned subreddits <span class="italic-text">D<sub>B</sub></span>, and subreddits related to both <span class="italic-text">D<sub>H</sub></span> and <span class="italic-text">D<sub>B</sub></span> which we label <span class="italic-text">D<sub>R</sub></span>. For each subreddit, we measure the user base and topical evolution for each month using latent vectors and clustering. <a href="javascript:scrollTo('#fig1-anchor')" class="italic-text">Figure 1 (c)</a> and <a href="javascript:scrollTo('#fig1-anchor')" class="italic-text">Figure 1 (d)</a> show how topics and user base correlate with subreddit age. The discrepancy in the graphs clearly indicates that subreddits do not achieve stability (both user and topical) over time, therefore necessitating constant content monitoring.</p>

				<p class="text">
                    To predict subreddit hateful evolution we create a dataset of subreddits and collect their data. The data is categorized into multiple categories: Community, Moderators, Users, Structural. We give each subreddit one of three labels: hateful, banned or benign. To capture the history of  subreddits in our dataset we divide each subreddit into 4 quarters of its lifetime this  allows us to see important features in different time of a subreddits life. 
				</p>
				<p class="text">
                    We train and test multiple models  our dataset including Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random Forest, Neural Network and SVM. Our models were able to predict labels for a subreddit with a high accuracy and F1 score. Moreover we were able to predict a subreddits label early into a subreddits life. One of the most impactful factors in deciding a subreddits label as hateful was its users being active in other hateful and banned subreddits as well.

				<p class="text">
                    Our models also predicted <span class="italic-text">r/The_Donald</span> to be a banned subreddit when it was currently not banned and soon enough reddit has quarantined <span class="italic-text">r/The_Donald</span>.

				<p class="text">
				Our findings suggest that community administration and moderation interventions can be used to pre-emptively mitigate the impact of such communities. In this section we study the evolution of users after they join a subreddit, or a subreddit that they are active in gets banned or quarantined. This analysis will help us measure the impact of moderation and its unseen ramifications. Furthermore, since we are also studying the change in user behaviour, this study helps us understand the effect of hateful communities on users.
				</p>
				<p class="text">
                    We observe using treatment and control users that users who join hateful subreddits show significant change in language and community participation. Using r/The_Donald as a case study we observe all incoming users and their comments over a period of 40 weeks, comparing these users to their control counterparts shows users get more offensive on a global scale.

    				These figures show that users after joining <span class="italic-text">r/The_Donald (Week 0 is their joining date)</span> start posting more Toxic, Insulting and Attacking comments on all communities compared to control users. These results show offensive communities can not be regarded as a bubble and their ill effects can be seen globally, therefore the existence and acceptance of such communities can not be ignored.
				</p>
				<p class="text">
				    We also look at the community participation change after users first engagement in <span class="italic-text">r/The_Donald</span>. The results show that hateful communities can indeed operate as offensive and hateful gateways introducing users to more offensive communities and initiating a positive feedback loop.
