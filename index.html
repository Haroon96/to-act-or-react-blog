                    Reddit, "the front page of the internet", has often found its communities play a prominent role in the origination and propagation of hateful discourse. The sheer number of posts and comments each day makes community moderation an arduous task for the handful of administrators on Reddit. Consequently, transgressions continue unchecked until they leak into the real world, at which point the media pressure leaves Reddit no choice but to take action.

                    This <b>reactive</b> approach to content moderation hasn’t worked well for Reddit. There are several examples of hateful discourse on Reddit reaching mainstream media, whose subsequent backlash prompts Reddit to take action. But it is far too late by then, as the damage has already been done.
